# Rattus: Crisis and Chivalry
 A Victoria 2 Mod based on a converted EU4 game on the foundations of HPM.

A bit of a wacky, unrealistic world where the global powers of the world have recently collapsed from a chain-reaction of economic tragedy and plagues. Countries with flavor or planned flavor:
Lotharingia
Spain
Italy
Zapadoslavia
Greece
Aksum
Scandinavia
America
Japan
Other countries may receive content but these are the priority targets for 1.0
